                        <p>Ti'm behind on these letters... and my journaling... and my school work to be honest. love that for myself. i'm going to just do a quick summary by the day because it will be way easier to follow! 

monday sept 25 
Today I got wrecked actually. Slammed my finger in a door and the entire nail is now purple but the swelling has gone down! But I can say that because it was throbbing the whole day, for the first time since being here, I didn't fall asleep in any of my classes! Today was another center day studying for the midterm in my Israel class! 

tuesday sept 26 
Today was another center study day. Ran on 5 hrs of sleep today with 8hrs of class lecture (one of those hours was our midterm test). I ended up doing decent on the test so luckily I should be averaging a B in most of my classes! B's are for balance here as I am balancing school work, social life, and exploring the city! 

wednesday sept 27 
Field trip day! I had some really special experiences this day that reminded me of and grew my love for the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Due to some circumstances happening back home, coupled with the stress I was feeling of school, and probably my lack of sleep I began the morning feeling so anxious. Our first sight was ruins of a Byzantine temple that commemorates the story of the Good Samaritan. Honestly I dont remember much from this sight because I felt so overwhelmed. We loaded the bus and drove to Wadi Qelt which is allegedly the wilderness that Christ fasted for 40 days in and then was visited by Satan and tempted. I couldn’t help but feel in awe at how the timing of all of the events during the past few days put me in a place when I was in the wilderness feeling empty and low, this is just a glimpse into how Jesus Christ must have felt after fasting. But then imagining being visited at this point by Satan whos one purpose is to destroy Jesus Christ. I felt relief as I thought about my Savior. God is the opposite of the wilderness. He gives us power that is life sustaining physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. 

The rest of the day just seemed to get better as we continued visiting each sight! Another highlight though was the Jordan River, the location of Jesus Christ's baptism. There were lots of Christians being baptized in the river. The joy on their faces was so pure and watching them made me realize how much good and truth other religions do have. I believe God leads ALL people who are trying to do good. And i also felt the responsibility that I have to share the FULL truth that I have been given with those who dont have all of the pieces! 

The last highlighted sight of today was Jericho, the lowest and oldest city in the world! Here there was the Spring of Elisha so things surrounding it were SO green. It was such a huge contrast from the hot, dry desert from earlier in the day which really confirmed to be the truth and significance of God being the Living Water!

friday sept 29 
Just skipping to the weekend because I'm realizing there is so much to write about! Today was the beginning o f the start of the Jewish holiday Sukkot so we walked to the Old City to see where Jews were building Sukkah, or tabernacles. These are just forts that they decorate and live in for the week! The festival was a really fun environment to be in! 

ill be sending another email with updates from this week in a few hours! stay tuned! 
                
                        <h2 class="section-heading">An Early Goobye to the Holy Land</h2>
                        <p>     I don’t even know how to begin this letter. This was a week unlike anything I’ve ever lived in my life. I experienced emotions and feelings that I did not know were possible. I don’t want to be dramatic. In reality, of all the people here in the Holy Land, I’ve definitely had the most mild experience. We have likely been in the safest place in the entire country. That being said, I wouldn’t want to experience this week again. I’ve learned so much about myself. I’ve learned so much about humanity. I’ve learned most about the gospel.

    I’ve thought about skipping the harder realities and just saying I’m safe and talking about the fun touristy things I’ve done this week, but mostly for my record I want to share my raw and real experience.

     The last email I wrote it was at the beginning of the war. Hamas had just invaded Israel but since that email things escalated incredibly quickly. This commenced an incredibly stressful week. It’s honestly all a blur, so I’ll try to hit the highlights. 

     The first four days were definitely the hardest. Every few minutes brought a notification of incoming missiles. Every hour brought a new news report. Every couple hours brought an emergency alarm in the city and the Jerusalem center which meant we gathered in the bomb shelter. Every sound or thud or door close or dropped book sounded like a bomb to us. We lived those days with complete uncertainty and honestly incredible disbelief. How are we in this scenario? Are we okay? Are we expected to function at full capacity? These are a few questions we asked ourselves. As students we distracted ourselves by studying for our two midterms. Students were scattered across the center staring mindlessly into their computers, failing most attempts to study. Somehow we managed. On top of it all, everybody was receiving texts from loved ones wondering when students would be sent home and letting us know they were praying for us. As thoughtful and meaningful as that was, it was unnerving for many students.

     When we weren’t stressed, we enjoyed each other‘s company, stayed up late, and speculated what would happen. We had dance parties, girls parties dressing up as “our type” and doing a fashion show, and a wonderful Passover Seder dinner. Our Judaism teacher came and taught us all about the Passover and we had about four hours of celebration and a wonderful meal. The cooks went above and beyond for us. It was some of the best food I’ve had since being here. I’ve come to respect both Islam and Judaism so much. 

     On Friday we were told to gather for another Q&A session with security and administration regarding the status of the conflict. We’ve had just a couple of these before but from the moment we arrived we could tell this meeting would be different. We FINALLY got information about the plan to move forward. We were told we needed to pack up as we will fly out of Tel Aviv to Athens in 48 hours. If that plan became too dangerous, we would drive across the West Bank and into Amman, Jordan and fly out from there. We would spend a week in Nafplio before our originally scheduled tour of Greece. At the end of the 2 weeks a decision to return would be made. 

     We grappled with the thoughts of missed opportunity yet overwhelming gratitude. We are in this country, full of people who want to leave. How did we become so blessed to have the resources to do so if needed? But also the thoughts of missing out on the rest of the semester were looming. I’ve been thinking a lot  about Lehi and his family being asked to leave Jerusalem, which they loved. They had the faith to leave. I felt I related to them in some senses, i am being asked to have that faith to leave what I had hoped for and a land I have begun to love. There are so many factors to the situation that make it incredibly difficult to process. 

     Saturday, our final night at the center was a dream. It was bittersweet as could be. Just before sunset, we all gathered on the terrace for pictures. It was like yearbook signing but just getting a picture with everyone there. It was a blast. We enjoyed each others company until we had a few final games to play with one another.

     The next morning was filled with final packing and goodbyes. Just before we left, we gathered all the local staff and sang to them. That was brutal. Honestly I am crying typing this email thinking about them now. It’s a hard reality for me to deal with to think of them still in that country caring for their families. And yet they spent so much time with us in the middle of everything. They are incredible. 

     We then left the center. The bus ride was less scary than I thought it would be. The cities were busy which was comforting. We arrived at the airport and things went relatively smooth initially. When we arrived at the airport we were told that an alarm would sound if a typical missile attack was underway. When we heard an alarm we were to go to the nearest bomb shelter. We had gone through this all week so it was not new to us.

     We got there when things were pretty quiet as they were only sending out flights at dark. The desks weren’t even open yet. We waited for 45 minutes to check our bags. As we began to go through customs, I turned around and saw security guards running frantically and yelling at everyone to “get down”.  I heard one say “gun” and I heard no alarm so I assumed Hamas or a like group was attacking the airport on foot. Thoughts of suicide bombers and gunmen terrorizing us flooded my mind. I turned back around to see a few of the girls around me crying so I grabbed their arms and started praying. Then two massive explosions followed. The whole building shook. I thought for sure there were bombs. After several minutes squatting we learned that the Iron Dome had intersected the middles being fired at the airport so we could continue to move through security. 

     We made our way to our gate and anxiously awaited our plane. Every sound once again, sounded like a bomb. I tried to process what just happened. Some kids told stories of looking above and seeing the iron dome getting some missiles through the window. Our flight delayed about 45 minutes and then we sat on the terminal for another 45 minutes waiting for the clear. 

     When we began to take off I was sitting next to an Israeli woman and her son. She said they were leaving to go somewhere safer and less chaotic. I looked out the window and was dumbfounded. Mesmerized? Taken aback…? I’m not sure. I had never felt that feeling. I saw that holy land in a whole new light. I felt awful for the people who had to stay. My heart sunk. My stomach turned. All the lights below us were homes filled with people and also filled with terror. Just in the distance other homes were being flattened. It was sickening. Yet I felt relief that I was getting out. How did I get so blessed? It’s not fair that I get to leave and they don’t. 

     Upon arriving in Greece I anticipated more relief but that honestly still hasn’t fully happened. We finally landed in Athens and everyone was so jumpy. Every suitcase hitting the ground was another explosion in our minds. We traveled from Athens to Napflio and arrived at 4 in the morning. 

    So we are here. It has been wild trying to remind myself that I am safe. But I am. And I’m so grateful. Greece is picturesque to say the least. I can tell why people dream of coming here !! 
     I will remain in Greece until the 31st of October and we received official news yesterday that we are being sent home early from our study abroad so I will be returning to the US in just a few weeks! 

    Thank you for all the prayers and concerns! 

     God has been very good to me through all of this. He has taught me so much.“This is my command be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.” -Joshua 1:9

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Spiritual Feast</h2>
                        <p>After having left their home in Jerusalem Lehi and his family had traveled hundreds of miles before Lehi is told by the Lord to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get the needed plates from a powerful yet wicked man named Laban. Lehi tells his sons and we all know of Nephi’s courageous response “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.” We also see the complaints and murmurings from Lehis other sons Laman and Lemuel. I want to point out the significance of different aspects of this story. </p> 
<p> First, Nephis courageous response.


If you read 1 Nephi 2:16 we learn why Nephi responded the way he did. He didn’t understand his fathers vision that lead to originally leaving Jerusalem, but Nephi wanted to know for himself that what his father was doing was what the Lord wanted, so he went and asked the Lord, expecting an answer And the lord softened his heart. That was why later when Nephi was asked to do something else challenging he acted courageously. He had developed a testimony of Jesus Christ. A lot of times we miss this concept. We just expect ourselves to be courageous and we think we expect a testimony to come.
Second, understanding the why. Laman and Lemuel were not wrong when they complained about being asked to do a hard thing, however, unlike Nephi they didn’t understand why they were doing it. When telling his sons to return to get the plates, Lehi emphasized to Nephi, this hard thing was “commanded” of the Lord—repeating that point three times to be sure he understood (1 Nephi 3:2, 4, 5). </p>

<p> The Youths theme for this year comes from the scripture of nephis courageous response and is emphasised “GO and DO.” Along with the new theme the youth were also introduced to a new program called children and youth. With this new program we are pursuing growth in the spiritual, physical, social and intellectual aspects of our lives. We set goals in these 4 categories. However we learn from Laman and lemuels complaints the importance of understanding. It is easy to set goals to go and do things on a check list. To go to church, to pay tithing. Laman and Lemuel went into the wilderness and they went back to Jerusalem but what separates them from Nephi is their faith. They didn’t “know that the lord had commanded it of them” or rather they didn’t have faith that god would provide a way for them. This year I hope the young women will now just simply go and do, but go and do with faith and understanding and with a trust and relationship in Jesus Christ.</p>
